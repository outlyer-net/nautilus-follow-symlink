caja-follow-symlink for Debian
------------------------------

This is an unofficial debian package created directly from the upstream
source, by the upstream author.
I'm no Debian Developer so I can't guarantee a strict following of the
Debian Policy.

I use Debian Sid, when possible I try to build against packages available in
Debian Stable but sometimes published packages will only work in Unstable.

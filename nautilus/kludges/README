libtool-honor-as-needed.patch contains a patch against ltmain.sh (generated
   on bootstrap to make use of libtool), so that it doesn't reorder
   "-Wl,--as-needed", a linker flag that removes unnecessary dependencies.
   It only applies to libraries listed after it, but libtool always pushes
   it after the libs in the command line, so it does nothing, normally.

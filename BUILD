COMPILATION
===========

* If no ./configure exists (i.e. raw svn export), use the dist command:
	$ ./dist

* Configure
	$ ./configure

	Note that this being a nautilus extension, the --prefix is not really needed
	as there's no real flexibility on where to install them. The appropiate place
	will be checked on install time.

* Compile
	$ make

* Install
	$ make install


Of special interest:
	Pass -D_DEBUG to the precompiler to enable the debugging/verbose
	mode.
		CPPFLAGS="-D_DEBUG" ./configure

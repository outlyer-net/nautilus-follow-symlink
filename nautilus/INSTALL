BUILD / INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=================================

Binaries for some distributions are provided in nautilus-follow-symlink's
homepage <http://p.outlyer.net/nautilus-follow-symlink>.

Building
========

Follow the usual GNU build instructions:

$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
	(or: $ ./configure --prefix=`pkg-config --variable prefix libnautilus-extension`)
$ make
# make install

	Note that this being a nautilus extension, the --prefix is not really used
	at installation time as there's no flexibility on where to install them
	(the appropiate place will be checked on install time). BUT it should match
	gnome's locale dir.


COMPILER NOTES
==============

* This program has only been tested with gcc

* Define _DEBUG in the preprocessor to enable the debugging/verbose mode.
	CPPFLAGS="-D_DEBUG" ./configure

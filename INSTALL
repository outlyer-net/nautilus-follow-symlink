BUILD / INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=================================

First and foremost, if you use Debian or a derived distribution try first
the upstream packages found at the project's homepage
<http://p.outlyer.net/nautilus-follow-symlink>. Or try building a deb
package yourself ($ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot)

Building
========

Run the included script "dist", this should create the missing files needed
to prepare the configuration. If some tool required to build is missing it
should also point it.

$ ./dist

The follow the usual GNU build instructions:

$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
$ make
# make install
